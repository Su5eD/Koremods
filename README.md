# Koremods

A bytecode modification framework running KTS/JSR-223

#### Note on syntax highlighting
Until [KT-31176](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-31176) is resolved, you need to build
the project to enable syntax highlighting in `core.kts` scripts, either using the `build` gradle task or `Build > Build Project` idea action, depending on what `Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Gradle > Build and run using` is set to.
