# Koremods

A Kotlin Script bytecode manipulation framework.

### Development

#### Note on syntax highlighting
Due to an [IDEA bug](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-31176), you need to compile the project in order
to enable syntax highlighting in `core.kts` scripts in this project's development environment. Dependencies
are unaffected by this bug.
